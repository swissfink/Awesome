## Background
The purpose of this project was to create a game that increases English vocabulary exposure and retention for students studying for the GREs.

One problem that members of the development group identified was that thousands of students are studying for the GREs. But many of the tools available to help them with the vocabulary portion are dull and, dare we say, boringâ€¦ and thus ineffective.

So this vocabulary game was created to make the process of learning vocabulary more fun and interactive.


### How it works

**Step 1**
User logs on to site URL and selects their game mode: synonyms, antonyms, or definitions.

**Step 2**
User is presented with a question. They then choose the correct matching option from a total of four possible words.

**Step 3**
User can choose to input their name and submit their scores. Otherwise, they are invited to play again.
